# Android KML map overlay app

## Single sentece description
This project is an Android app that displays KML or KMZ overlays on top of OSMDroid map, or Google maps.

## Goal overview

There are map overlays created every day for any of the following purposes:

- real estate house and boundry locations
- land property lines
- water ways (rivers, lakes, oceans)
- travel routes (e.g. Pacific Crest Trail)
- mining maps
- geology maps
- hydrology maps
- population distribution maps
- ecology
- polution
- crime

- many other
 
In fact, government organizations and universities create many of these map overlays, usualy in KML (or zipped KMZ) formats that are underutilized. 
This  application allows you to load these KMZ, KML files and use them in the field on your Android phone or tablet.
