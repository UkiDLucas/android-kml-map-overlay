To download the map tiles use Mobile Atlas Creator (http://mobac.sourceforge.net/)
Steps are as follows, most settings are done in the options pane to the left of the map:

1. Set atlas format to OSMDroid ZIP [Atlas - Convert Atlas Format].
2. Set your map area coordinates, either by clicking and dragging on the map,
   or by setting min and max coordinates in the coordinate selection pane to the left.
3. Select one or more of OpenStreetMapQuest, OpenStreetMap Osmrender, OpenStreetMap Cyclemap, OpenStreetMap Public Transport.
4. Select the zoom levels you want to include. This will impact the storage space required. As you select more levels, the number of tiles
   needed are displayed. Each pane takes about 20 kilobytes.
5. In the Atlas Content pane, set the name of your map first, then click “add selection” (the name really isn’t important, though).
6. Then select “Create atlas” and your map is stored in the atlas folder under Mobile Atlas Creator.
7. Move the resulting zip-file to /mnt/sdcard/kmlmapoverlays/ on your device.
